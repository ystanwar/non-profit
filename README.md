This repository is created to help the non-profit organisations and provide them a template to use for the noble causes.Initiallly I started this as a website for youneed NGO ,Ahmedadbad and created this website keeping in mind their requirements but now I would like to improve it and help as many non-profits as I can.
Front-end work is almost complete ,the design is minimalistic as I wanted to keep it simple ,improvents can be done in front-end and will be made in near furture any chnages towards the betterment of front-end are welocome.
Initially I started backend with php and my sql but now I have decided to do it using ruby on rails framework but it will take time because I am a beginner in ruby on rails ,but any improvement in back-end in any languages are welcome.
